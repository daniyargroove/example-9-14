My name is Daniyar Mussin. I have a Bachelor's degree in civil and industrial construction and Master's degree in standardization, certification and metrology. I have a 2 years of experience of working as a Architectural and Civil drafter, but this year I decided to change my occupation and become a fintech software engineer.

My career goal is to start a path of a software engineer in one the financial institutes such as J.P.Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Blackrock, Vanguard, Goldman Sachs, etc.

I chose a fintech as a career path because I always had an interest to find out how do all financial processes happen, what's the inside of a great companies. I want to be a part of a team of specialists who develop fintech software for people around the world.
